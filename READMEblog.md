## 📖 About the Project

This is my first self-made project under the name **Codersao** — a real-time video chat and messaging platform built using **WebRTC**, **Socket.io**, and **Node.js**.

I dedicated **16 nights** and spent over **150+ hours** developing this project from scratch. It's been an exciting journey filled with debugging, testing, and learning!

## 💡 Features

- Real-time **video chat** using WebRTC  
- **Chat box** with instant messaging (fully working)  
- Built using **Node.js** and **Socket.io** for signaling  
- Clean and responsive UI  
- Beta access available for testers  
- Plan to add an **admin panel** in the future

---

## 🔧 Development Notes

### ✅ Final Status (as of April 4):
- Fixed issues in `server.js` and client-side script files  
- Chat is working perfectly  
- WebRTC video now works **on localhost**  
- Ready to push code to **GitHub**  
- The current version does not include a loading screen for video — direct P2P connection is established

---

## 🛠️ Known Issues

- **WebRTC video may not work** on hosted servers due to potential **network/server issues**  
- Server sometimes **crashes** because it’s running on localhost  
- Minor bugs (like slow P2P connection) will be fixed in the future  
- No loading screen while the video is connecting (planned improvement)

---

## 🧪 Testing Experience

During beta testing:
- The **chat box** performed smoothly  
- **Video call** did not work due to server setup, not code errors  
- The issue is suspected to be related to `node_modules` or local server configuration

## 🔥 Final Thoughts

> When errors come, they take time to solve — but it’s **never impossible**.  
> Fix it step-by-step. Check which part is causing the issue. Eventually, it all comes together.

This is just the beginning. I’m proud of this build and excited for what comes next! 🧠💻
