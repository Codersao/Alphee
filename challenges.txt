Hi, it's me, Jatin â€” Codersao!

This is my website: www.Codersao.in

I worked on this project for 16 nights and spent over 150+ hours developing it.
Now, the code is ready, but I'm not entirely sure why the WebRTC video isn't working properly.
Iâ€™ve checked all my code and believe this might be a localhost server issue rather than a coding error.

When I tested the code on localhost, the video started working automatically, which makes me think the code itself is fine.
However, I suspect there might be some issues with node_modules, which I plan to fix later.

I also tested the chat box, and it's working perfectly.
Currently, the website doesnâ€™t have an admin panel â€” we plan to add it later.

If everything works fine and we fix the remaining issues, the project will be 100% complete.

I provided beta access for testing, but sometimes my server crashes because Iâ€™m using localhost as the server.
Video chat wasnâ€™t enabled during beta testing due to network or server issuesâ€”Iâ€™m not entirely sure which one.
I'll fix this issue soon.

Now, let's test it on the local server and see if everything is running smoothly! ðŸš€

April 4th, Night Update
I fixed the code!
I updated the server.js and script files â€” everything is working now.
This is my first self-made project, and Iâ€™m ready to push it to GitHub!
I hope you're reading this "challenge file" â€” it means a lot to me.

Summary:
When an error shows up, it might take time to fixâ€¦
But it's not impossible if we go step by step and carefully check which part is causing the issue.
Now I can finally move on to the next project â€” this one is done!

In the future, if I have time, Iâ€™ll fix a few small bugs too â€” like improving P2P connection speed.
I havenâ€™t added a loading screen for the video either â€” right now it directly connects.
